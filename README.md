# Graph Theory

This repository is dedicated to my **Gráficos y Juegos** course. It's purpose is to store code implementations that complement my learning process.
Since the course is heavily based on mathematics and formal proofs, I have decided to implement these abstract concepts as Python scripts to better understand their behavior and logic.

## Graph

### Definition

A **graph** $G$ is an ordered pair $(V(G), E(G))$ where:

- $V(G)$ is a non-empty set of **vertices**.
- $E(G)$ is a set of **edges**, each being an unordered pair $\{u, v\}$ of distinct vertices from $V(G)$.
